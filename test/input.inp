# Configuration file for EZNMA, comments lines start with "#"
      
#1 [job_name] as name prefix for output files.
# not mandatory, default is <ez-nma>
#job_name	spastin-hexamer

#2 [nma_coor] specifies coordinates perform normal mode analysis
# madatory, need this to build Hessian array.
nma_coor	pdb/spastin-hexamer-without-mtbd-ordered.pdb

#3 [r_cutoff] specifies cutoff distance to build spring network.
# For ENM, r_cutoff is recommended to be set between 13 to 15A (Eyal 2006).
# not mandatory, default is 10.0
r_cutoff	14.0

#4 [n_modes] specifies numer of normal modes with lowest 
# frequencies (energies) needed to write.
# not mandatory, default is 10, maxium is 3*Natom
n_modes		100

#5 [ref_coor] specifies coordinates file to calculate overlap.
# not required if overlap calculation is not needed.
# ref_coor referce_coordiante.pdb

#6 [vmd_file] specifes file name to write tcl commands
# for visualization of spring network. this feature can be done using 
vmd_file   spring-network

#7 [tol] specifies the error tolerance to diagonalize Hessian
# matrix, default is 1e-6. It's not recommended for user to
# modify this value thus not shown here.
